# Evaluation of Cycle Finding Algorithms on Large Linked List

This is a trivial implementation of three linked list cycle finding algorithms along with its performance evaluation.

## Run

This code should run on Mac OS and Linux with a valid `g++` installation that supports C++ 11. For Mac OS, run `brew install gnu-time` first. For Linux, modify `eval.sh` to use `time` instead.

```shell script
bash -x eval.sh
```

## Result
